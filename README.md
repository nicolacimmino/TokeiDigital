# TokeiDigital

TokeiDigital [to̞ke̞ːdigital] is a line of clocks for geeks, nerds, and makers that come in a kit to assemble. The clock faces are unconventional and, true to the spirit of this project, always abound with colorful, blinking lights. These clocks are for you if:

* You believe a UART is a cool interface to setup a clock.
* You believe setting registers HEX values in a terminal is a good way to change LED colors and tweak settings.
* You believe a clock that just shows time with two hands is boring.
